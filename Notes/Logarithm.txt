The logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation.

log (10) 1000 = 3 (logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed value, the base must be raised to produce that number)

10 ^ 3 = 1000

Logarithm to base 10 is called the common logarithm.

Natural logarithm has number e ~ 2.718 as its base.

Binary logarithm uses base 2.

The idea of logarithm is to reverse the operation of exponentiation.
