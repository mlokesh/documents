Stack memory:
-Xss
Size can't be changed after the process starts
each method has its own stack
it's stack exists only during the life time of that method
used to store local variables and function call
stack is much faster to allocate in comparision to variables on the heap
each thread in java has their own stack
no memory left in the stack: java.lang.StackOverFlowError


Heap memory:
-Xms
-Xmx
heap memory is used to store objects (member variables, local variable or class variable)
variables on heap must be destroyed by garbage collector
throws java.lang.OutOfMemoryError when it runs out of memory

Heap is the portion of the memory where dynamically allocated portion resides. (malloc)
