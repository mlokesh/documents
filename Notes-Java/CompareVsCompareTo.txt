Comparator Vs Comparable:

1. Comparator in java is defined in java.util package while Comparable interface is defined in java.lang package,
   which very much says that Comparator should be used as an utility to sort objects which Comparable should be
   provided by default.

2. Comparator interface in java has method
    public int compare (Object o1, Object o2) which returns a
        Negative Integer :   First argument is less than the second
        0                :   First argument is equal to second
        Positive Integer :   First argument is greater than the second

3. Comparable interface in java has a method
    public int compareTo (Object o)
        Negative Integer    :   Object is less than the specified object
        0                   :   Object is equal to the specified object
        Positive Integer    :   Object is greater than the specified object

4. So in Summary if you want to sort objects based on natural order then use Comparable in Java and if you want to sort
   on some other attribute of object then use Comparator in Java.


Comparable - compareTo(Object o) - Use for natural sorting and implemented in the main class.
Comparator - compare(Object o1, Object o2) - Use for custom sorting and create separate comparator for each sort fields.
